## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Setup your environment:

```sh
NODE_ENV='production'
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build` and the server

- `server.js`
- `build/server`
- `build/client`

Take a look at the provided Dockerfile for further details on how to configure a production environment.
